    # This block is not actually functional configuration,
    # but serves to illustrate the available configuration
    # options and document them in a way that is accessible
    # to users that `kubectl edit` this config map.
    #
    # These sample configuration options may be copied out of
    # this example block and unindented to be in the data block
    # to actually change the configuration.

    # Default value for domain.
    # Routes having the cluster domain suffix (by default 'svc.cluster.local')
    # will not be exposed through Ingress. You can define your own label
    # selector to assign that domain suffix to your Route here, or you can set
    # the label
    #    "networking.knative.dev/visibility=cluster-local"
    # to achieve the same effect.  This shows how to make routes having
    # the label app=secret only exposed to the local cluster.

      selector:
        app: secret

    # These are example settings of domain.
    # example.com will be used for all routes, but it is the least-specific rule so it
    # will only be used if no other domain matches.
    example.com: |

    # example.org will be used for routes having app=nonprofit.
    example.org: |
