# Kubeflow on AWS

## Overview

This branch is forked from the [Kubeflow Manifests](https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests) repository to develop and validate Kubeflow on AWS. This repository contains configuration files and [overlays](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/kustomization/#bases-and-overlays) to deploy Kubeflow on [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/).

## Getting Started

There are a number of deployment options for installing Kubeflow with AWS service integrations. For detailed instructions regarding available AWS-integrated deployment options, see the [distributions/aws/examples](distributions/aws/examples) directory.
