# Kubeflow on AWS

## Overview

Kubeflow on AWS is an open source distribution of [Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/) that provides its own Kubeflow manifests to support integrations with various AWS managed services. Use Kubeflow on AWS to streamline data science tasks and build highly reliable, secure, and scalable machine learning systems with reduced operational overheads.

## Getting Started

There are a number of deployment options for installing Kubeflow with AWS service integrations. To get started with deploying Kubeflow on [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/), see the [deployment section](https://awslabs.github.io/kubeflow-manifests/docs/deployment/) on the [Kubeflow on AWS](https://awslabs.github.io/kubeflow-manifests/) website.
