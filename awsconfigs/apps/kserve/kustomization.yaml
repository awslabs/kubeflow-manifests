# kserve offers 2 installation options for serverless: standalone installation (in its own namespace) and a Kubeflow one
# See: https://github.com/kserve/kserve/tree/release-0.7/install/v0.7.0
# In 1.5 since both KFServing and KServe were included, Kserve standalone installation was used to avoid conflicts in resource names
# but in doing so the default ingress gateway configured became knative-serving/knative-ingress-gateway which does not exist in Kubeflow installation
# Kubeflow integrated installation should use kubeflow/kubeflow-gateway
# this overlay fixes what is achieved by https://github.com/kserve/kserve/blob/release-0.7/config/overlays/kubeflow/params.env#L1 and should eventually be merged upstream
bases:
- ../../../upstream/contrib/kserve/kserve

# To make namespace for standalone installation kustomizable,
# variabalize ingress gateway, webhook service name and
# kserve namespace in webhook configurations
