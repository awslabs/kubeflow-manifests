> Note: Terraform deployment options are still in preview.

## Background

This guide will walk you through using Terraform to:
- Create a VPC
- Create an EKS cluster
- Create a S3 bucket
- Create an RDS DB instance
- Deploy Kubeflow with RDS as a KFP and Katib persistence layer and S3 as an artifact store

Terraform documentation can be found [here](https://www.terraform.io/docs).

## Prerequisites

Be sure that you have satisfied the [installation prerequisites]({{< ref "../prerequisites.md" >}}) before working through this guide.

Specifially, you must:
- [Create a Ubuntu environment]({{< ref "../prerequisites/#create-ubuntu-environment" >}})
- [Clone the repository]({{< ref "../prerequisites/#clone-repository" >}})
- [Install the necessary tools]({{< ref "../prerequisites/#install-necessary-tools" >}})


Additionally, ensure you are in the `REPO_ROOT/deployments/rds-s3/terraform` folder.

If you are in repository's root folder, run:
```sh
cd deployments/rds-s3/terraform
pwd
```

## Deployment Steps

### Configure

1. Create an IAM user to use with the Minio Client

    [Create an IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html#id_users_create_cliwpsapi) with permissions to get bucket locations and allow read and write access to objects in an S3 bucket where you want to store the Kubeflow artifacts. Take note of the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY of the IAM user that you created to use in the following step, which will be referenced as `TF_VAR_minio_aws_access_key_id` and `TF_VAR_minio_aws_secret_access_key` respectively.

1. Define the following environment variables:

    ```sh
    # Region to create the cluster in
    export CLUSTER_REGION=
    # Name of the cluster to create
    export CLUSTER_NAME=
    # AWS access key id of the static credentials used to authenticate the Minio Client
    export TF_VAR_minio_aws_access_key_id=
    # AWS secret access key of the static credentials used to authenticate the Minio Client
    export TF_VAR_minio_aws_secret_access_key=
    # true/false flag to configure and deploy with RDS
    export USE_RDS="true"
    # true/false flag to configure and deploy with S3
    export USE_S3="true"
    ```

1. Save the variables to a `.tfvars` file:

    ```sh
    cat <<EOF > sample.auto.tfvars
    cluster_name="${CLUSTER_NAME}"
    cluster_region="${CLUSTER_REGION}"
    generate_db_password="true"
    use_rds="${USE_RDS}"
    use_s3="${USE_S3}"

    # The below values are set to make cleanup easier but are not recommended for production
    deletion_protection="false"
    secret_recovery_window_in_days="0"
    force_destroy_s3_bucket="true"
    EOF
    ```

### All Configurations

A full list of inputs for the terraform stack can be found [here](https://github.com/awslabs/kubeflow-manifests/blob/main/deployments/rds-s3/terraform/variables.tf).

### Preview

View a preview of the configuration you are about apply:
```sh
terraform init && terraform plan
```

### Apply

Run the following command:
```sh
make deploy
```

## Connect to your Kubeflow dashboard

For information on connecting to your Kubeflow dashboard depending on your deployment environment, see [Port-forward (Terraform deployment)]({{< ref "../connect-kubeflow-dashboard/#port-forward-terraform-deployment" >}}). Then, [log into the Kubeflow UI]({{< ref "../connect-kubeflow-dashboard/#log-into-the-kubeflow-ui" >}}).

## Cleanup

Uninstall Kubeflow on AWS with a single command. 
```sh
make delete
```
