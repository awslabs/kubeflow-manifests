Kubeflow on AWS is differentiated from the open-source KubeFlow project by a custom build manifest that provides integrations with various AWS services that are highly available and scalable. This reduces the operational overhead of maintaining the Kubeflow platform. 

If you want to deploy Kubeflow with minimal changes, but optimized for [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) (Amazon EKS), then consider the [vanilla](/kubeflow-manifests/docs/deployment/vanilla/guide/) deployment option. The Kubeflow on AWS control plane is installed on top of Amazon EKS, which is a managed container service used to run and scale Kubernetes applications in the cloud.

Kubeflow on AWS provides integration with the [Amazon Relational Database Service](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) (RDS) for highly scalable and available pipelines and metadata store. RDS removes the need to manage a local MYSQL database service and storage. Kubeflow on AWS also provides integration with [Amazon Simple Storage Service](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) (S3) for an easy-to-use pipeline artifacts store. S3 removes the need to host the local object storage MinIO. You can deploy Kubeflow on AWS with both [RDS and S3](/kubeflow-manifests/docs/deployment/rds-s3/guide/) or [using only RDS or only S3](/kubeflow-manifests/docs/deployment/rds-s3/guide/#using-only-rds-or-only-s3).

Integrate your deployment with [AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) for user authentication, which removes the complexity of managing user pools or connectors in Kubeflowâ€™s native Dex authorization service. For more information, see the [Cognito deployment guides](/kubeflow-manifests/docs/deployment/cognito/). You can also deploy Kubeflow on AWS with all available service integrations by following the [Cognito, RDS, and S3 deployment guide](/kubeflow-manifests/docs/deployment/cognito-rds-s3/guide/). 

Experiment with Kubeflow on AWS add-ons for additional service integrations. For Kubeflow notebook Workspace Volumes and Data Volumes, see the [Amazon Elastic File System](https://aws.amazon.com/efs/) (EFS) [add-on guide](/kubeflow-manifests/docs/deployment/add-ons/storage/efs/guide/) or the [Amazon FSx for Lustre](https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/lustre/) (Amazon FSx) [add-on guide](/kubeflow-manifests/docs/deployment/add-ons/storage/fsx-for-lustre/guide/) for increased training performance. You can integrate with [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) for persistent log management, which addresses the default K8s log limits and improves your log availability and monitoring capabilities. For more information see the CloudWatch [add-on guide](/kubeflow-manifests/docs/deployment/add-ons/cloudwatch/guide/). You can also add secure external traffic management to the Kubeflow dashboard using the [AWS Application Load Balancer](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/application-load-balancer/) (ALB) [add-on guide](/kubeflow-manifests/docs/deployment/add-ons/load-balancer/guide/).
