Starting with Kubeflow on AWS v1.6, all of the available [deployment options]({{< ref "../deployment/_index.md" >}}) are integrated with Amazon SageMaker using SageMaker Operators for Kubernetes (ACK) and SageMaker Components for Kubeflow Pipelines. 

Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed service designed for handling performant and cost-optimized training clusters that are only provisioned when requested, scaled as needed, and shut down automatically when jobs complete, allowing you to operationalize machine leaning workflows with optimized resource utilization.
