[AWS Deep Learning Containers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/deep-learning-containers/latest/devguide/what-is-dlc.html) are framework-optimized deep learning environments for training and serving models. Use AWS Deep Learning Containers to simplify inference workloads with KServe and Kubeflow on AWS.

For tutorials, see Kubeflow on AWS [Inference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/deep-learning-containers/latest/devguide/deep-learning-containers-eks-kubeflow-tutorials-inference.html) in the *AWS Deep Learning Containers Developer Guide*.
