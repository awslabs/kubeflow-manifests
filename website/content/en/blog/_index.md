In this section, we share posts, articles, and videos illustrating how some of our customers have leveraged **AWS distribution of Kubeflow** to optimize large-scale and compute-intensive machine learning workloads, we provide ML infrastructure recommendations and best practices, and we inform you on Kubelow on AWS coming training sessions and available recordings.

Want to **try the latest version of Kubeflow on AWS**? Follow the steps in [Kubeflow on AWS documentation](http://localhost:1313/kubeflow-manifests/main/docs/deployment/prerequisites/).

## Read

A curated list of blogs illustrating how to build flexible, scalable ML workflows on Kubernetes using AWS distribution of Kubeflow. 
Find case studies, use cases, best practices, benchmarks, and more.

1. **[ Architecture ]** 
    [Build and deploy a scalable machine learning system on Kubernetes with Kubeflow on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/build-and-deploy-a-scalable-machine-learning-system-on-kubernetes-with-kubeflow-on-aws/). Based on Kubeflow-1.4.

1. **[ Case Study ]**
    Find out how [Athenahealth uses Kubeflow on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/build-repeatable-secure-and-extensible-end-to-end-machine-learning-workflows-using-kubeflow-on-aws/) to build and streamline an end-to-end data science workflow that preserves essential tooling, optimizes operational efficiency, increases data scientist productivity, and sets the stage for extending their ML capabilities more easily.

1. **[ Architecture ]** 
    [Build an hybrid distributed training architecture using Kubeflow on AWS and Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/build-flexible-and-scalable-distributed-training-architectures-using-kubeflow-on-aws-and-amazon-sagemaker/). This post further illustrates how you can use open-source libraries in your deep learning training script and still make it compatible to run on both Kubernetes and SageMaker in a platform agnostic way.

1. **[ Architecture ]** 
    [Use Amazon SageMaker Operators for Kubernetes (ACK) to train and deploy machine learning models](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/use-amazon-sagemaker-ack-operators-to-train-and-deploy-machine-learning-models/).


## Watch 

This section curates a list of recorded virtual workshops, demos, and general presentations illustrating how to leverage Kubeflow on AWS and SageMaker to build, run, and monitor scalable ML workflows on Kubernetes.

1. **[ AWS Online Tech Talks ]**: [AWS Virtual Workshop "Distributed Training using PyTorch with Kubeflow on AWS and AWS DLC"](http://youtu.be/qctwfYZKK8M) - Demonstrates how Kubeflow on AWS integration with AWS Deep Learning Containers and Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) allows building and training PyTorch based deep learning models on both Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) with flexibility and scale in a hybrid architecture. Attended by over 50 customers. Aug 23rd, 2022

1. **[ AWS On Air ]**: [re:Inforce Session "Hybrid distributed training architecture using Kubeflow and SageMaker"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPJXFXq6woA) - Attended by over 900 customers. July 27, 2022

1. **[ AWS On Air ]**: [Live at re:Mars Session "Deploy and scale your ML workflow on Kubernetes with Kubeflow on AWS"](https://www.linkedin.com/video/live/urn:li:ugcPost:6945501585447804929/). You will be prompted to log into LinkedIn.
