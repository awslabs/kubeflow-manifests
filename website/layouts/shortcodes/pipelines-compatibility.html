<p><i>Due to <a href="https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/issues/1700">kubeflow/pipelines#1700</a>, the container builder in Kubeflow Pipelines currently prepares credentials for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) only. As a result, the container builder supports only Google Container Registry. However, you can store the container images on other registries, provided you set up the credentials correctly to fetch the image.</i></p>
