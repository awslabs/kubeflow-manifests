This guide describes how to use the kustomize + kubectl to deploy Kubeflow on IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service (IKS).

## Prerequisites

* Authenticate with IBM Cloud

  Log into IBM Cloud using the [IBM Cloud Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cli) as follows:

  ```shell
  ibmcloud login
  ```

  Or, if you have federated credentials, run the following command:
  
  ```shell
  ibmcloud login --sso  
  ```

* Create and access a Kubernetes cluster on IKS

  To deploy Kubeflow on IBM Cloud, you need a cluster running on IKS. If you don't have a cluster running, follow the [Create an IBM Cloud cluster](/docs/ibm/create-cluster) guide.

  Run the following command to switch the Kubernetes context and access the cluster:
  
  ```shell
  ibmcloud ks cluster config --cluster <cluster_name>
  ```

  Replace `<cluster_name>` with your cluster name.

* kustomize (version 3.2.0) ([download link](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/releases/tag/v3.2.0))

* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) with [passlib](https://pypi.org/project/passlib/)
  and [bcrypt](https://pypi.org/project/bcrypt/) packages installed

### Storage setup for a **Classic** IBM Cloud Kubernetes cluster

**Note**: This section is only required when the worker nodes provider `WORKER_NODE_PROVIDER` is set to `classic`. For other infrastructures, IBM Cloud Storage with Group ID support is already set up as the cluster's default storage class.

When you use the `classic` worker node provider of an IBM Cloud Kubernetes cluster, it uses the regular [IBM Cloud File Storage](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/file-storage) based on NFS as the default storage class. File Storage is designed to run RWX (read-write multiple nodes) workloads with proper security built around it. Therefore, File Storage [does not allow `fsGroup` securityContext](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-security#container) unless it's configured with Group ID, which is needed for the [OIDC authentication service](https://github.com/arrikto/oidc-authservice) and Kubeflow Jupyter server.

Therefore, you're recommended to set up the default storage class with Group ID support so that you can get the best experience from Kubeflow.

1. Set the File Storage with Group ID support as the default storage class.

    ```shell
    NEW_STORAGE_CLASS=ibmc-file-gold-gid
    OLD_STORAGE_CLASS=$(kubectl get sc -o jsonpath='{.items[?(@.metadata.annotations.storageclass\.kubernetes\.io\/is-default-class=="true")].metadata.name}')
    kubectl patch storageclass ${NEW_STORAGE_CLASS} -p '{"metadata": {"annotations":{"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class":"true"}}}'

    # List all the (default) storage classes
    kubectl get storageclass | grep "(default)"
    ```

    Example output:
    ```
    ibmc-file-gold-gid (default)   ibm.io/ibmc-file    Delete          Immediate           false                  14h
    ```

2. Make sure `ibmc-file-gold-gid` is the only `(default)` storage class. If there are two or more rows in the above output, unset the previous `(default)` storage classes with the command below:
    ```shell
    kubectl patch storageclass ${OLD_STORAGE_CLASS} -p '{"metadata": {"annotations":{"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class":"false"}}}'
    ```

### Storage setup for **vpc-gen2** IBM Cloud Kubernetes cluster

**Note**: To deploy Kubeflow, you don't need to change the storage setup for `vpc-gen2` Kubernetes cluster.

Currently, there is no option available for setting up RWX (read-write multiple nodes) type of storages.
RWX is not a mandatory requirement to run Kubeflow and most pipelines.
It is required by certain sample jobs/pipelines where multiple pods write results to a common storage.
A job or a pipeline can also write to a common object storage like `minio`, so the absence of this feature is 
not a blocker for working with Kubeflow.
Examples of jobs/pipelines that will not work, are: 
[Distributed training with Kubeflow TFJob](https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator/tree/master/examples/tensorflow/mnist_with_summaries)

If you are on `vpc-gen2` and still need RWX, you may try [portworx enterprise product](https://portworx.com/products/features/).
To set it up on IBM Cloud use the [portworx install with IBM Cloud](https://docs.portworx.com/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/cloud/ibm/) guide. 


## Installation 

Choose either **single user** or **multi-tenant** section based on your usage.

If you're experiencing issues during the installation because of conflicts on your Kubeflow deployment, you can [uninstall Kubeflow](/docs/ibm/deploy/uninstall-kubeflow) and install it again.

## Single user

Using kustomize together with kubectl to deploy kubeflow:

1. Clone the manifest repo as follows:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/IBM/manifests.git -b v1.4.0 ibm-manifests-140
   ```

2. Change directory to `ibm-manifests-140`:

   ```shell
   cd ibm-manifests-140
   ```

3. Generate password for default user: `user@example.com`
   ```shell
   python3 -c 'from passlib.hash import bcrypt; import getpass; print(bcrypt.using(rounds=12, ident="2y").hash(getpass.getpass()))'
   ```
   Type your password and press `<Enter>` after you see `Password:` prompt. Copy the hash code for next step.

4. Edit `dist/stacks/ibm/application/dex-auth/custom-env.yaml` and fill the relevant field
   with the hash code from previous step:
   ```
   staticPasswords:
   - email: user@example.com
     hash: <enter the generated hash here>
   ```
   You can also change the email value if needed.

5. Apply the `kustomize` file under `iks-single` folder for single user deployment:

   ```shell
   while ! kustomize build iks-single | kubectl apply -f -; do echo "Retrying to apply resources"; sleep 10; done
   ```

### Accessing your cluster

The Kubeflow endpoint is exposed with [NodePort](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#nodeport) `30380`. To get a static ip, you can [expose the Kubeflow endpoint as a LoadBalancer](#expose-the-kubeflow-endpoint-as-a-loadbalancer) and access the **EXTERNAL_IP**.

For single-user Kubeflow, IBM Cloud uses Dex authentication by default. You can access the cluster using
the email and password you specified in step 3 and 4 of [Single User](#single-user)

## Multi-user, auth-enabled

Run the following steps to deploy Kubeflow with [IBM Cloud AppID](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/app-id)
as an authentication provider. 

The scenario is a Kubeflow cluster admin configures Kubeflow as a web
application in AppID and manages user authentication with builtin identity
providers (Cloud Directory, SAML, social log-in with Google or Facebook etc.) or
custom providers.

### Prerequisites

For authentication,  IBM Cloud uses [AppID](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/app-id)

1. Follow the [Creating an App ID service instance on IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/app-id) guide to learn about Kubeflow authentication. 
You can also learn [how to use App ID](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/appid?topic=appid-getting-started) with different authentication methods.

2. Follow the [Registering your app](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/appid?topic=appid-app#app-register)
   section of the App ID guide to create an application with type
   _regularwebapp_ under the provisioned AppID instance. Make sure the _scope_
   contains _email_. Then retrieve the following configuration parameters from your AppID:
    * `clientId`
    * `secret`
    * `oAuthServerUrl`

   You will be using these information in the subsequent sections.
  
3. Register the Kubeflow OIDC redirect page. The Kubeflow `REDIRECT_URL` URL is
   `[http|https]://<kubeflow-FQDN>/login/oidc`, depends on if you enable the HTTPS or not.
   `<kubeflow-FQDN>` is the endpoint for accessing Kubeflow. By default, the `<kubeflow-FQDN>`
   on IBM Cloud is `<worker_node_external_ip>:30380`. To get a static ip, you can
   [expose the Kubeflow endpoint as a LoadBalancer](#expose-the-kubeflow-endpoint-as-a-loadbalancer)
   and use the **EXTERNAL_IP** for your `<kubeflow-FQDN>`. Or use `ibmcloud ks nlb-dns` command
   to map the **EXTERNAL_IP** to the generated FQDN for your cluster. In this case, you use the
   generated FQDN as `kubeflow-FQDN`. If you enable HTTPS, you shall use generated FQDN.

4. Then, you need to place the Kubeflow OIDC `REDIRECT_URL` under **Manage Authentication** > **Authentication settings** > **Add web redirect URLs**.
  
   <img src="/docs/images/ibm/appid-redirect-settings.png" alt="APP ID Redirect Settings" class="mt-3 mb-3 border border-info rounded">

   Example:
   `https://my-kubeflow-442dbba0442be6c8c50f31ed96b00601-0000.sjc04.containers.appdomain.cloud/login/oidc`
### Deploy: Using kustomize together with kubectl

1. Clone the manifest repo as follows:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/IBM/manifests.git -b v1.4.0 ibm-manifests-140
   ```

2. Change directory to `ibm-manifests-140`:

   ```shell
   cd ibm-manifests-140
   ```

3. Update the `dist/stacks/ibm/application/oidc-authservice-appid/params.env`
   with values collected in [Prereq](#prerequisites-1) section.
   You will need the following values:
    * `<oAuthServerUrl>` - replace `<APP_ID_oauthServerUrl>`
    * `<kubeflow-FQDN>` - fill in the FQDN of Kubeflow, if you don't know yet, just give a dummy one like
      `localhost`. Then change it after you got one. Or get default FQDN of your cluster by this command:
      `ibmcloud ks nlb-dns ls -c <cluster name>` (replace `<cluter name>` with your cluster name)

   Example:
   ```
   OIDC_PROVIDER=https://us-south.appid.cloud.ibm.com/oauth/v4/f341ff8b-a088-497a-same-5da4628df7fd
   REDIRECT_URL=https://my-kubeflow-442dbba0442be6c8c50f31ed96b00601-0000.sjc04.containers.appdomain.cloud/login/oidc
   OIDC_AUTH_URL=https://us-south.appid.cloud.ibm.com/oauth/v4/f341ff8b-a088-497a-same-5da4628df7fd/authorization
   ```

4. Update the `dist/stacks/ibm/application/oidc-authservice-appid/secret_params.env`
   with values collected in [Prereq](#prerequisites-1) section.
   You will need the following values:
    * `<clientId>` - replace the `<APP_ID_clientId>`
    * `<secret>` - replace the `<APP_ID_secret>`

   Example:
   ```
   CLIENT_SECRET=NjNhZDA3ODAtM2I3MCSECRETLTkwN2QtNDdhYmU5ZGIyMTBl
   CLIENT_ID=52b3e496-8888-8888-ABC9-c0da309cdf52
   ```

5. You can apply the `kustomize` file in `iks-multi` folder:

   ```bash
   while ! kustomize build iks-multi | kubectl apply -f -; do echo "Retrying to apply resources"; sleep 10; done
   ```

6. If at any point the values change and you have to change them, you can either patch the
   [configmap](#patch-configmap) and [secret](#patch-secret) or change the content in the
   files and apply the kustomize again. You will need to restart authservice with
   `kubectl delete pod -l app-authservice -n istio-system` .

   To apply just the `oidc-authservice-appid` you can use this command:

   ```bash
   kustomize build dist/stacks/ibm/application/oidc-authservice-appid | kubectl apply -f -
   kubectl delete pod -l app-authservice -n istio-system
   ```

### Verify mutli-user installation

Check the pod `authservice-0` is in running state in namespace `istio-system`:

```SHELL
kubectl get pod -l app=authservice -n istio-system
```

### Extra network setup requirement for **vpc-gen2** clusters only

**Note**: These steps are not required for `classic` clusters, i.e. where `WORKER_NODE_PROVIDER` is set to `classic`.

A `vpc-gen2` cluster does not assign a public IP address to the Kubernetes master node by default.
It provides access via a Load Balancer, which is configured to allow only a set of ports over public internet.
Access the cluster's resources in a `vpc-gen2` cluster, using one of the following options,

* Load Balancer method: To configure via a Load Balancer, go to [Expose the Kubeflow endpoint as a LoadBalancer](#expose-the-kubeflow-endpoint-as-a-loadbalancer).
    This method is recommended when you have Kubeflow deployed with [Multi-user, auth-enabled](#multi-user-auth-enabled) support — otherwise it will expose
  cluster resources to the public.

* Socks proxy method: If you need access to nodes or NodePort in the `vpc-gen2` cluster, this can be achieved by starting another instance in the 
same `vpc-gen2` cluster and assigning it a public IP (i.e. the floating IP). Next, use SSH to log into the instance or create an SSH socks proxy,
  such as `ssh -D9999 root@new-instance-public-ip`.

Then, configure the socks proxy at `localhost:9999` and access cluster services.

* `kubectl port-forward` method: To access Kubeflow dashboard, run `kubectl -n istio-system port-forward service/istio-ingressgateway 7080:http2`.
    Then in a browser, go to[http://127.0.0.1:7080/](http://127.0.0.1:7080/)

_**Important notice**: Exposing cluster/compute resources publicly without setting up a proper user authentication mechanism
is very insecure and can have very serious consequences(even legal). If there is no need to expose cluster services publicly,
Socks proxy method or `kubectl port-forward` method are recommended._

## Next steps: secure the Kubeflow dashboard with HTTPS

### Prerequisites

For both `classic` and `vpc-gen2` cluster providers, make sure you have [Multi-user, auth-enabled](#multi-user-auth-enabled) Kubeflow set up.

### Setup

Follow the steps in [Exposing the Kubeflow dashboard with DNS and TLS termination](../authentication/#exposing-the-kubeflow-dashboard-with-dns-and-tls-termination).
Then, you will have the required DNS name as Kubeflow FQDN to enable the OIDC flow for AppID:


1. Follow the step [Adding redirect URIs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/appid?topic=appid-managing-idp#add-redirect-uri)
   to fill a URL for AppID to redirect to Kubeflow. The URL should look like `https://<kubeflow-FQDN>/login/oidc`.

2. Update the secret `appid-application-configuration` with the updated Kubeflow FQDN to replace `<kubeflow-FQDN>` in below command:

   ```SHELL
   export REDIRECT_URL=https://<kubeflow-FQDN>/login/oidc
   export PATCH=$(printf '{"data": {"REDIRECT_URL": "%s"}}' "$REDIRECT_URL")

   kubectl patch configmap/oidc-authservice-parameters -n istio-system -p="$PATCH"
   ```

3. Restart the pod `authservice-0`:

   ```shell
   kubectl delete pod -l app=authservice -n istio-system
   ```

Then, visit `https://<kubeflow-FQDN>/`. The page should redirect you to AppID for authentication.

## Troubleshooting

### Expose the Kubeflow endpoint as a LoadBalancer

By default, the Kubeflow deployment on IBM Cloud only exposes the endpoint as [NodePort](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#nodeport) 31380. If you want to expose the endpoint as a [LoadBalancer](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer), run:

```shell
kubectl patch svc istio-ingressgateway -n istio-system -p '{"spec": {"type": "LoadBalancer"}}'
```

Then, you can locate the LoadBalancer in the **EXTERNAL_IP** column when you run the following command:

```shell
kubectl get svc istio-ingressgateway -n istio-system
```

There is a small delay, usually ~5 mins, for above commands to take effect.

### Authservice pod taking too long to restart

You might see the `authservice-0` pod taking some time to restart. If that happens you can delete to pod which will kick off restart from kubernetes reconciler.

```bash
kubectl delete pod -l app=authservice -n istio-system
```
