This guide describes how to delete the Kubeflow deployment when it is deployed with the Kubeflow Operator.

To delete the Kubeflow deployment, simply delete the KfDef custom resource from the cluster.

```shell
kubectl delete kfdef ${KUBEFLOW_DEPLOYMENT_NAME} -n ${KUBEFLOW_NAMESPACE}
```

Note: ${KUBEFLOW_DEPLOYMENT_NAME} and ${KUBEFLOW_NAMESPACE} are defined in the [Installing Kubeflow](/docs/methods/operator/install-kubeflow) guide.
