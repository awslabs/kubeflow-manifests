This guide describes how to use the Kubeflow Operator to deploy Kubeflow. As mentioned in the Operator [introduction](/docs/methods/operator/introduction.md), the Operator also allows you to monitor and manage the Kubeflow installation beyond the initial installation.

## Prerequisites

* Kubeflow Operator needs to be deployed on your cluster for rest of steps to work. Please follow the [`Install the Kubeflow Operator`](/docs/methods/operator/install-operator) guide to install the Kubeflow Operator

## Deployment Instructions

The Kubeflow Operator uses the KfDef as its custom resource. You can compose a KfDef configuration or pick a default KfDef from the Kubeflow [manifests](https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/tree/master/kfdef) repo. Keep in mind choosing the release that will work with the Kubeflow Operator.

### Prepare KfDef configuration

The `metadata.name` field must be set for the KfDef manifests whether it is downloaded from the Kubeflow manifests repo or is originally written. Following example shows how to prepare the KfDef manifests

```shell
# download a default KfDef configuration from remote repo
export KFDEF_URL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/manifests/v1.1-branch/kfdef/kfctl_ibm.yaml
export KFDEF=$(echo "${KFDEF_URL}" | rev | cut -d/ -f1 | rev)
curl -L ${KFDEF_URL} > ${KFDEF}

# add metadata.name field
# Note: yq can be installed from https://github.com/mikefarah/yq
export KUBEFLOW_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=kubeflow
yq w ${KFDEF} 'metadata.name' ${KUBEFLOW_DEPLOYMENT_NAME} > ${KFDEF}.tmp && mv ${KFDEF}.tmp ${KFDEF}
```

### Deploy the Kubeflow with the Kubeflow Operator

Kubeflow Operator is watching on any KfDef resource in the Kubernetes cluster. Depends on how the operator is installed, there are a couple of ways to start the Kubeflow deployment. You can always manually run with following commands

```shell
# create the namespace for Kubeflow deployment
KUBEFLOW_NAMESPACE=kubeflow
kubectl create ns ${KUBEFLOW_NAMESPACE}

# create the KfDef custom resource
kubectl create -f ${KFDEF} -n ${KUBEFLOW_NAMESPACE}
```

Note: in the example above, ${KFDEF} points to a local KfDef configuration file, however, it can also points to a remote URL containing a valid KfDef configuration.

### Watch the deployment progress

The Kubeflow deployment is carried on by the operator, you can watch the progress with this command

```shell
kubectl logs deployment/kubeflow-operator -n ${OPERATOR_NAMESPACE} -f
```

Verify the Kubeflow deployment by monitoring the pods in the ${KUBEFLOW_NAMESPACE}

```shell
kubectl get pod -n ${KUBEFLOW_NAMESPACE}
