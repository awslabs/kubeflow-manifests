    "\n",
    "A Kubeflow pipeline is a portable and scalable definition of an ML workflow,\n",
    "based on containers. A pipeline is composed of a set of input parameters and a\n",
    "list of the steps in this workflow. Each step in a pipeline is an instance of a\n",
    "component, which is represented as an instance of \n",
    "[`ContainerOp`][container-op].\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "*   Orchestrate repeatable ML workflows.\n",
    "*   Accelerate experimentation by running a workflow with different sets of\n",
    "    hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding pipeline components\n",
    "\n",
    "A pipeline component is a containerized application that performs one step in a\n",
    "pipeline's workflow. Pipeline components are defined in\n",
    "[component specifications][component-spec], which define the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   The component's interface, its inputs and outputs.\n",
    "*   The component's implementation, the container image and the command to\n",
    "    execute.\n",
    "*   The component's metadata, such as the name and description of the\n",
    "    component.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can build components by [defining a component specification for a\n",
    "containerized application][component-dev], or you can [use the Kubeflow\n",
    "Pipelines SDK to generate a component specification for a Python\n",
    "function][python-function-component]. You can also [reuse prebuilt components\n",
    "in your pipeline][prebuilt-components]. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the pipeline graph\n",
    "\n",
    "Each step in your pipeline's workflow is an instance of a component. When\n",
    "you define your pipeline, you specify the source of each step's inputs. Step\n",
    "inputs can be set from the pipeline's input arguments, constants, or step\n",
    "inputs can depend on the outputs of other steps in this pipeline. Kubeflow\n",
    "Pipelines uses these dependencies to define your pipeline's workflow as\n",
    "a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a pipeline with the following steps: ingest data,\n",
    "generate statistics, preprocess data, and train a model. The following\n",
    "describes the data dependencies between each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Ingest data**: This step loads data from an external source which is\n",
    "    specified using a pipeline argument, and it outputs a dataset. Since\n",
    "    this step does not depend on the output of any other steps, this step\n",
    "    can run first.\n",
    "*   **Generate statistics**: This step uses the ingested dataset to generate\n",
    "    and output a set of statistics. Since this step depends on the dataset\n",
    "    produced by the ingest data step, it must run after the ingest data step.\n",
    "*   **Preprocess data**: This step preprocesses the ingested dataset and\n",
    "    transforms the data into a preprocessed dataset. Since this step depends\n",
    "    on the dataset produced by the ingest data step, it must run after the\n",
    "    ingest data step.\n",
    "*   **Train a model**: This step trains a model using the preprocessed dataset,\n",
    "    the generated statistics, and pipeline parameters, such as the learning\n",
    "    rate. Since this step depends on the preprocessed data and the generated\n",
    "    statistics, it must run after both the preprocess data and generate\n",
    "    statistics steps are complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the generate statistics and preprocess data steps both depend on the\n",
    "ingested data, the generate statistics and preprocess data steps can run in\n",
    "parallel. All other steps are executed once their data dependencies are\n",
    "available.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Designing your pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "When designing your pipeline, think about how to split your ML workflow into\n",
    "pipeline components. The process of splitting an ML workflow into pipeline\n",
    "components is similar to the process of splitting a monolithic script into\n",
    "testable functions. The following rules can help you define the components\n",
    "that you need to build your pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Components should have a single responsibility. Having a single\n",
    "    responsibility makes it easier to test and reuse a component. For example,\n",
    "    if you have a component that loads data you can reuse that for similar\n",
    "    tasks that load data. If you have a component that loads and transforms\n",
    "    a dataset, the component can be less useful since you can use it only when\n",
    "    you need to load and transform that dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "*   Reuse components when possible. Kubeflow Pipelines provides [components for\n",
    "    common pipeline tasks and for access to cloud\n",
    "    services][prebuilt-components].\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Note: Not all prebuilt components are compatible with Pipelines SDK v2.\n",
    "    For example, you might need to update the type hints for component inputs\n",
    "    and outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Consider what you need to know to debug your pipeline and research the\n",
    "    lineage of the models that your pipeline produces. Kubeflow Pipelines\n",
    "    stores the inputs and outputs of each pipeline step. By interrogating the\n",
    "    artifacts produced by a pipeline run, you can better understand the\n",
    "    variations in model quality between runs or track down bugs in your\n",
    "    workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, you should design your components with composability in mind. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pipelines are composed of component instances, also called steps. Steps can\n",
    "define their inputs as depending on the output of another step. The\n",
    "dependencies between steps define the pipeline workflow graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building pipeline components\n",
    "\n",
    "Kubeflow pipeline components are containerized applications that perform a\n",
    "step in your ML workflow. Here are the ways that you can define pipeline\n",
    "components:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   If you have a containerized application that you want to use as a\n",
    "    pipeline component, create a component specification to define this\n",
    "    container image as a pipeline component.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This option provides the flexibility to include code written in any\n",
    "    language in your pipeline, so long as you can package the application\n",
    "    as a container image. Learn more about [building pipeline\n",
    "    components][component-dev].\n",
    "\n",
    "*   If your component code can be expressed as a Python function, [evaluate if\n",
    "    your component can be built as a Python function-based\n",
    "    component][python-function-component]. The Kubeflow Pipelines SDK makes it\n",
    "    easier to build lightweight Python function-based components by saving you\n",
    "    the effort of creating a component specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever possible, [reuse prebuilt components][prebuilt-components] to save\n",

    "Python function-based component and reuses a prebuilt component.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding how data is passed between components\n",
    "\n",
    "When Kubeflow Pipelines runs a component, a container image is started in a\n",
    "Kubernetes Pod and your component’s inputs are passed in as command-line\n",
    "arguments. When your component has finished, the component's outputs are\n",
    "returned as files.\n",
    "\n",
    "In your component's specification, you define the components inputs and outputs\n",
    "and how the inputs and output paths are passed to your program as command-line\n",
    "arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Component inputs and outputs are classified as either _parameters_ or _artifacts_,\n",
    "depending on their data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Parameters typically represent settings that affect the behavior of your pipeline.\n",
    "    Parameters are passed into your component by value, and can be of any of\n",
    "    the following types: `int`, `double`, `float`, or `str`. Since parameters are\n",
    "    passed by value, the quantity of data passed in a parameter must be appropriate\n",
    "    to pass as a command-line argument.\n",
    "*   Artifacts represent large or complex data structures like datasets or models, and\n",
    "    are passed into components as a reference to a file path.\n",
    "\n",
    "    If you have large amounts of string data to pass to your component, such as a JSON\n",
    "    file, annotate that input or output as a type of [`Artifact`][kfp-artifact], such\n",
    "    as [`Dataset`][kfp-artifact], to let Kubeflow Pipelines know to pass this to\n",
    "    your component as a file.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    In addition to the artifact’s data, you can also read and write the artifact's\n",
    "    metadata. For output artifacts, you can record metadata as key-value pairs, such\n",
    "    as the accuracy of a trained model. For input artifacts, you can read the\n",
    "    artifact's metadata &mdash; for example, you could use metadata to decide if a\n",
    "    model is accurate enough to deploy for predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "All outputs are returned as files, using the the paths that Kubeflow Pipelines\n",
    "provides.\n",
