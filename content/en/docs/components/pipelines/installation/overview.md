Kubeflow Pipelines offers a few installation options.
This page describes the options and the features available
with each option:

* [Kubeflow Pipelines Standalone](#kubeflow-pipelines-standalone) is the minimal
portable installation that only includes Kubeflow Pipelines.
* Kubeflow Pipelines as [part of a full Kubeflow deployment](#full-kubeflow-deployment) provides
all Kubeflow components and more integration with each platform.
* **Beta**: [Google Cloud AI Platform Pipelines](#google-cloud-ai-platform-pipelines) makes it easier to install and use Kubeflow Pipelines on Google Cloud by providing a management UI on [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/ai-platform/pipelines/clusters).
* A [local](/docs/components/pipelines/installation/localcluster-deployment) Kubeflow Pipelines deployment for testing purposes.

## Choosing an installation option

1. Do you want to use other Kubeflow components in addition to Pipelines?

    If yes, choose the [full Kubeflow deployment](#full-kubeflow-deployment).
1. Can you use a cloud/on-prem Kubernetes cluster?

    If you can't, you should try using Kubeflow Pipelines on a local Kubernetes cluster for learning and testing purposes by following the steps in [Deploying Kubeflow Pipelines on a local cluster](/docs/components/pipelines/installation/localcluster-deployment).
1. Do you want to use Kubeflow Pipelines with [multi-user support](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/issues/1223)?

    If yes, choose the [full Kubeflow deployment](#full-kubeflow-deployment) with version >= v1.1.
1. Do you deploy on Google Cloud?

    If yes, deploy [Kubeflow Pipelines Standalone](#kubeflow-pipelines-standalone). You can also
    use [Google Cloud AI Platform Pipelines](#google-cloud-ai-platform-pipelines) to deploy Kubeflow Pipelines
    using a user interface, but there are limitations in
    customizability and upgradability. For details, please read corresponding
    sections.
1. You deploy on other platforms.

    Please compare your platform specific [full Kubeflow](#full-kubeflow-deployment) with the
    [Kubeflow Pipelines Standalone](#kubeflow-pipelines-standalone) before making your decision.

**Warning:** Choose your installation option with caution, there's no current
supported path to migrate data between different installation options. Please
create [a GitHub issue](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/issues/new/choose)
if that's important for you.


<a id="standalone"></a>
## Kubeflow Pipelines Standalone

Use this option to deploy Kubeflow Pipelines to an on-premises, cloud
or even local Kubernetes cluster, without the other components of Kubeflow.
To deploy Kubeflow Pipelines Standalone, you use kustomize manifests only.
This process makes it simpler to customize your deployment and to integrate
Kubeflow Pipelines into an existing Kubernetes cluster.

Installation guide
: [Kubeflow Pipelines Standalone deployment
  guide](/docs/components/pipelines/installation/standalone-deployment/)

Interfaces
:
  * Kubeflow Pipelines UI
  * Kubeflow Pipelines SDK
  * Kubeflow Pipelines API
  * Kubeflow Pipelines endpoint is **only auto-configured** for Google Cloud.

  If you wish to deploy Kubeflow Pipelines on other platforms, you can either access it through
  `kubectl port-forward` or configure your own platform specific auth-enabled
  endpoint by yourself.

Release Schedule
: Kubeflow Pipelines Standalone is available for every Kubeflow Pipelines release.
You will have access to the latest features.

Upgrade Support (**Beta**)
: [Upgrading Kubeflow Pipelines Standalone](/docs/components/pipelines/installation/standalone-deployment/#upgrading-kubeflow-pipelines) introduces how to upgrade
in place.

Google Cloud Integrations
:
  * A Kubeflow Pipelines public endpoint with auth support is **auto-configured** for you.
  * Open the Kubeflow Pipelines UI via the **Open Pipelines Dashboard** link in [the AI Platform Pipelines dashboard of Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/ai-platform/pipelines/clusters).
  * (Optional) You can choose to persist your data in Google Cloud managed storage (Cloud SQL and Cloud Storage).
  * [All options to authenticate to Google Cloud](/docs/gke/pipelines/authentication-pipelines/) are supported.

Notes on specific features
:
  * After deployment, your Kubernetes cluster contains Kubeflow Pipelines only.
  It does not include the other Kubeflow components.
  For example, to use a Jupyter Notebook, you must use a local notebook or a
  hosted notebook in a cloud service such as the [AI Platform
  Notebooks](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/notebooks/docs/).
  * Kubeflow Pipelines multi-user support is **not available** in standalone, because
  multi-user support depends on other Kubeflow components.

<a id="full-kubeflow"></a>
## Full Kubeflow deployment

Use this option to deploy Kubeflow Pipelines to your local machine, on-premises,
or to a cloud, as part of a full Kubeflow installation.

Installation guide
: [Kubeflow installation guide](/docs/started/getting-started/)

Interfaces
:
  * Kubeflow UI
  * Kubeflow Pipelines UI within or outside the Kubeflow UI
  * Kubeflow Pipelines SDK
  * Kubeflow Pipelines API
  * Other Kubeflow APIs
  * Kubeflow Pipelines endpoint is auto-configured with auth support for each platform

Release Schedule
: The full Kubeflow is released quarterly. It has significant delay in receiving
Kubeflow Pipelines updates.

Note: Google Cloud, AWS, and IBM Cloud have supported Kubeflow Pipelines 1.0.0 with multi-user separation. Other platforms might not be up-to-date for now, refer to [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/issues/1364#issuecomment-668415871) for status.

Upgrade Support
:
Refer to [the full Kubeflow section of upgrading Kubeflow Pipelines on Google Cloud](/docs/gke/pipelines/upgrade/#full-kubeflow) guide.

Google Cloud Integrations
:
  * A Kubeflow Pipelines public endpoint with auth support is **auto-configured** for you using [Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy](https://cloud.google.com/iap).
  * There's no current support for persisting your data in Google Cloud managed storage (Cloud SQL and Cloud Storage). Refer to [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/issues/4356) for the latest status.
  * You can [authenticate to Google Cloud with Workload Identity](/docs/gke/pipelines/authentication-pipelines/#workload-identity).

Notes on specific features
:
  * After deployment, your Kubernetes cluster includes all the
  [Kubeflow components](/docs/components/).
  For example, you can use the Jupyter notebook services
  [deployed with Kubeflow](/docs/components/notebooks/) to create one or more notebook
  servers in your Kubeflow cluster.
  * Kubeflow Pipelines multi-user support is **only available** in full Kubeflow. It supports
  using a single Kubeflow Pipelines control plane to orchestrate user pipeline
  runs in multiple user namespaces with authorization.
  * Latest features and bug fixes may not be available soon because release
  cadence is long.
