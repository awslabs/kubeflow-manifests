A *graph* is a pictorial representation in the Kubeflow Pipelines UI of the
runtime execution of a pipeline. The graph shows the steps that a pipeline run
has executed or is executing, with arrows indicating the parent/child
relationships between the pipeline components represented by each step. The
graph is viewable as soon as the run begins. Each node within the graph
corresponds to a step within the pipeline and is labeled accordingly.

The screenshot below shows an example of a pipeline graph:

At the top right of each node is an icon indicating its status: running,
succeeded, failed, or skipped. (A node can be skipped when its 
parent contains a conditional clause.)
