KFServing enables serverless inferencing on Kubernetes and provides performant, high abstraction interfaces for common machine learning (ML) frameworks like TensorFlow, XGBoost, scikit-learn, PyTorch, and ONNX to solve production model serving use cases.

You can use KFServing to do the following:

* Provide a Kubernetes [Custom Resource Definition](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) for serving ML models on arbitrary frameworks.

* Encapsulate the complexity of autoscaling, networking, health checking, and server configuration to bring cutting edge serving features like GPU autoscaling, scale to zero, and canary rollouts to your ML deployments.

* Enable a simple, pluggable, and complete story for your production ML inference server by providing prediction, pre-processing, post-processing and explainability out of the box.

Our strong community contributions help KFServing to grow. We have a Technical Steering Committee driven by Bloomberg, IBM Cloud, Seldon, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and NVIDIA. [Browse the KFServing GitHub repo](https://github.com/kubeflow/kfserving) to give us feedback!

## Install with Kubeflow

KFServing works with Kubeflow 1.3. Kustomize installation files are [located in the manifests repo](https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/tree/master/apps/kfserving/upstream).
Check the examples running KFServing on Istio/Dex in the [`kubeflow/kfserving`](https://github.com/kubeflow/kfserving/tree/master/docs/samples/istio-dex) repository. For installation on major cloud providers with Kubeflow, follow their installation docs.

Kubeflow 1.3 includes KFServing v0.5.1 which promoted the core InferenceService API from v1alpha2 to v1beta1 stable and added v1alpha1 version of Multi-Model Serving. Additionally, LFAI Trusted AI Projects on AI Fairness, AI Explainability and Adversarial Robustness have been integrated in KFServing, and we have made KFServing available on OpenShift as well. To know more, please read the [release blog](https://blog.kubeflow.org/release/official/2021/03/08/kfserving-0.5.html) and follow the [release notes](https://github.com/kubeflow/kfserving/releases/tag/v0.5.0)
