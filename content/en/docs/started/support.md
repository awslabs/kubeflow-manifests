## Application status

Starting from the release of Kubeflow v1.0, the Kubeflow community
attributes *stable status* to those applications and components that
meet a defined level of stability, supportability, and upgradability.

When you deploy Kubeflow to a Kubernetes cluster, your deployment includes a
number of applications. Application versioning is independent of Kubeflow
versioning. An application moves to version 1.0 when the application meets
certain [criteria](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/blob/master/guidelines/application_requirements.md)
in terms of stability, upgradability, and the provision of services such as
logging and monitoring.

When an application moves to version 1.0, the Kubeflow community will
decide whether to mark that version of the application as *stable* in the next
major or minor release of Kubeflow.

Application status indicators for Kubeflow:

* **Stable** means that the application complies with the
  [criteria](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/blob/master/guidelines/application_requirements.md)
  to reach application version 1.0, and that the Kubeflow community has deemed
  the application stable for this release of Kubeflow.
* **Beta** means that the application is working towards a version 1.0 release
  and its maintainers have communicated a timeline for satisfying the criteria
  for the stable status.
* **Alpha** means that the application is in the early phases of
  development and/or integration into Kubeflow.

<a id="levels-of-support"></a>
## Levels of support

The following table describes the level of support that you can expect based on the status of an application:

<div class="table-responsive">
  <table class="table table-bordered">
    <thead class="thead-light">
      <tr>
        <th>Application status</th>
        <th>Level of support</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Stable</td>
        <td>The Kubeflow community offers <i>best-effort support</i> for stable
          applications. See the section on 
          <a href="#community-support">community support</a> below for a
          definition of best-effort support and the community channels where you 
          can report and discuss the problem. You can also consider requesting 
          support from a 
          <a href="#provider-support">Kubeflow community provider</a> or from 
          your <a href="#cloud-support">cloud provider</a>.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Beta</td>
        <td>The Kubeflow community offers <i>best-effort support</i> for beta
          applications. See the section on 
          <a href="#community-support">community support</a> below for a
          definition of best-effort support and the community channels where you 
          can report and discuss the problem. 
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Alpha</td>
        <td>The response differs per application in alpha status, depending on
          the size of the community for that application and the current level
          of active development of the application.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

## Support from the Kubeflow community

Kubeflow has an active and helpful community of users and contributors. 

The Kubeflow community offers support on a best-effort basis for stable and beta
applications.
**Best-effort support** means that there's no formal agreement or
commitment to solve a problem but the community appreciates the
importance of addressing the problem as soon as possible. The community commits
to helping you diagnose and address the problem if all the following are true:

* The cause falls within the technical framework that Kubeflow controls. For
  example, the Kubeflow community may not be able to help if the problem is 
  caused by a specific network configuration within your organization.
* Community members can reproduce the problem.
* The reporter of the problem can help with further diagnosis and 
  troubleshooting.

You can ask questions and make suggestions in the following places:

* **Slack** for online chat and messaging. See details of Kubeflow's 
  [Slack workspace and channels](/docs/about/community/#slack).
* **Kubeflow discuss** for email-based group discussion. Join the
  [kubeflow-discuss](/docs/about/community/#mailing-list)
  group.
* **Kubeflow documentation** for overviews and how-to guides. In particular,
  refer to the following documents when troubleshooting a problem:

  * [Kubeflow installation and setup](/docs/started/getting-started/)
  * [Kubeflow components](/docs/components/)
  * [Further setup and troubleshooting](/docs/other-guides/)

* **Kubeflow issue trackers** for known issues, questions, and feature requests.
  Search the open issues to see if someone else has already logged the problem 
  that you're encountering and learn about any workarounds to date. If no one
  has logged your problem, create a new issue to describe the problem.

    Each Kubeflow application has its own issue tracker within the [Kubeflow
    organization on GitHub](https://github.com/kubeflow). To get you started,
    here are the primary issue trackers:

  * [Kubeflow core](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/issues)
  * [kfctl command-line tool](https://github.com/kubeflow/kfctl/issues)
  * [Kustomize manifests](https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/issues)
  * [Kubeflow Pipelines](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/issues)
  * [Katib AutoML](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib/issues)
  * [Metadata](https://github.com/kubeflow/metadata/issues)
  * [Fairing notebook SDK](https://github.com/kubeflow/fairing/issues)
  * [Kubeflow Training (TFJob, PyTorchJob, MXJob, XGBoostJob)](https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator/issues)
  * [KFServing](https://github.com/kubeflow/kfserving/issues)
  * [Examples](https://github.com/kubeflow/examples/issues)
  * [Documentation](https://github.com/kubeflow/website/issues)
