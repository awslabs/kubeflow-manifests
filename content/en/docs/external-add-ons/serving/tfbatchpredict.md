[TensorFlow batch prediction](https://github.com/kubeflow/batch-predict) is not 
supported in Kubeflow versions greater than v0.6. See the [Kubeflow v0.6 
documentation](https://v0-6.kubeflow.org/docs/external-add-ons/serving/tfbatchpredict/)
for earlier support for batch prediction with TensorFlow models.
